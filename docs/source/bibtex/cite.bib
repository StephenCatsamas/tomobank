  abstract={Abstract There is a widening gap between the fast advancement of computational methods for tomographic reconstruction and their successful implementation in production software at various synchrotron facilities. This is due in part to the lack of readily available instrument datasets and phantoms representative of real materials for validation and comparison of new numerical methods.&#13; &#13; Recent advancements in detector technology made sub-second and multi-energy tomographic data collection possible, but also increased the demand to develop new reconstruction methods able to handle in-situ and dynamic systems that can be quickly incorporated in beamline production software.&#13; &#13; The X-ray Tomography Data Bank, tomoBank, provides a repository of experimental and simulated datasets with the aim to foster collaboration among computational scientists, beamline scientists, and experimentalists and to accelerate the development and implementation of tomographic reconstruction methods for synchrotron facility production software by providing easy access to challenging datasets and their descriptors.}
