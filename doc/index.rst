There is mismatch between fast advancement of computational methods for tomographic 
reconstruction and their implementation in production software at various synchrotron 
facilities. This is due in part to the lack of instrument data sets readily available 
to computational scientists for validation and comparison of the new methods.The X-ray Tomography Data Bank or TomoBank, provides a repository of experimental 
and simulated data sets with the aim to foster collaboration among computational scientists, 
beamline scientists and experimentalists, to accelerate their implementation in the synchrotron 
facility production software and to advance the development of tomographic reconstruction methods.
